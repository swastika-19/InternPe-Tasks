## InternPe Tasks
<p>These are two of my tasks that I did in my Java programming internship with InternPe.</p>

### Guess the Number game
<p>A Java-based 'Guess the Number' game where the user guesses a random number between 1-100. The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or low, aiding in reaching the correct number efficiently. It enhances user experience through clear prompts and intuitive gameplay.</p>
